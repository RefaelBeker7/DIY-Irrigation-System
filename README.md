> Smart Drip Irrigation. Android app and connects by Bluetooth to the Arduino.

This is an open-source application to water plants automatically. Up to now, there is almost no free professional software and instructions available to build DYI irrigation that is scalable, accurate, and most importantly, durable. Above all, it is a tool to tailor the sensors to the exact needs of the plants  with direct soil moisture measurement.
